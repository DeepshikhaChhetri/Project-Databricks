ðŸ’¡ Result - Trend Over Time in Retention Rate:
This section analyzes the retention rates of customer cohorts based on their first purchase month. Retention rates are calculated as the percentage of customers within a cohort who placed a second order within 1, 2, and 3 months of their initial purchase.

Highest Retention Rates by Time Threshold:

The cohort demonstrating the highest retention rate for each specified time threshold is as follows -

1-Month Retention: The June 2024 cohort exhibits the highest 1-month retention rate at 80.00%.
2-Month Retention: The June 2024 cohort demonstrates the highest 2-month retention rate at 100.00%.
3-Month Retention: Both the May 2024 and June 2024 cohorts show the highest 3-month retention rate at 100.00%.
Notable Differences in Short-Term Retention Across Cohorts:

Significant variations in short-term retention rates are observed across the analyzed customer cohorts -

One-Month Retention Disparity: The 1-month retention rates range considerably, from a low of 34.62% for the April 2024 cohort to a high of 80.00% for the June 2024 cohort. The February 2024 cohort also exhibits a relatively low 1-month retention rate of 44.68%. In contrast, the May and June 2024 cohorts demonstrate substantially higher initial retention.

Two-Month Retention Improvement: Generally, the 2-month retention rates show an increase across all cohorts compared to the 1-month rates, indicating that a larger proportion of customers make a repeat purchase within a two-month window. However, the February and April 2024 cohorts continue to exhibit comparatively lower 2-month retention rates. The June 2024 cohort achieves a perfect 100.00% retention within two months.

Three-Month Retention Convergence: The 3-month retention rates further increase for most cohorts. Notably, both the May and June 2024 cohorts reach a 100.00% retention rate within three months. While the earlier cohorts (January, February, March, April 2024) show a gradual improvement in retention over the three-month period, the April 2024 cohort still lags behind the others.

Conclusion: The analysis reveals notable differences in short-term customer retention across the examined cohorts. The more recent cohorts (May and June 2024) demonstrate stronger initial loyalty, as evidenced by their higher retention rates within the first three months. Conversely, the February and April 2024 cohorts consistently exhibit lower short-term retention, suggesting potential factors impacting customer engagement or acquisition during those periods that warrant further investigation. The overall trend of increasing retention rates from the 1-month to the 3-month threshold is expected as customers have more time to make a second purchase.

ðŸ’¡ Result - Trends Over Time in Repeat Purchase Rates:
This section examines the repeat purchase rates for different customer cohorts, specifically focusing on the percentage of customers who placed at least a 2nd, 3rd, and 4th order, segmented by their first purchase month.

Trends Over Time in Repeat Purchase Rates:

Analyzing the repeat purchase rates across the cohorts, ordered chronologically from January 2024 to June 2024, reveals the following potential trends -

Second Order Repeat Rate: The rate at which customers place a second order remains generally high across all cohorts, frequently reaching 100%. Minor reductions are observed in the February and April 2024 cohorts. Overall, a significant upward or downward trend for the second order repeat rate is not apparent within this timeframe.

Third Order Repeat Rate: The third order repeat rate suggests a downward trend in more recent cohorts, particularly pronounced in the June 2024 cohort, which exhibits a significant drop to 70.00% compared to the high 90s observed in earlier cohorts. The May 2024 cohort also shows a slightly lower third order repeat rate compared to the January and February 2024 cohorts.

Fourth Order Repeat Rate: A clear downward trend is evident in the fourth order repeat rate as we progress from earlier to more recent cohorts. The rate begins at 83.33% for the January 2024 cohort and consistently declines to 60.00% for the June 2024 cohort. The May 2024 cohort also displays a notably lower fourth order repeat rate.

Summary of Trends:

In summary, the analysis of repeat purchase rates by cohort indicates -

The second order repeat rate demonstrates relative stability at a high level across the observed period.
The third order repeat rate shows a tendency to decrease in more recent cohorts.
The fourth order repeat rate exhibits a distinct and consistent downward trend as the first purchase month becomes more recent. This suggests a decreasing propensity for newer customer cohorts to place four or more orders compared to those acquired earlier in the observed period.
Consideration: It is important to acknowledge that the more recent cohorts (specifically May and June 2024) comprise a smaller number of total customers. This smaller sample size may render the calculated percentages more susceptible to individual customer behavior and potentially amplify fluctuations in the observed rates. However, the consistent downward trend in the fourth order repeat rate across the later cohorts warrants attention.

ORDER BY cohort_month ASC;

ðŸ’¡ Result - Cohort Size by Month Analysis
This section examines the size of customer cohorts based on the month of their first purchase. The cohort size is determined by the number of new customers acquired in each specific month.

Largest Cohort: Based on the analysis, the month with the highest number of new customers, and therefore the largest cohort, is January 2024, with 66 new customers.

Variation of Cohort Size Over Time:

The cohort size exhibits a clear trend of decreasing over the observed period from January 2024 to June 2024.

Initial Large Cohort: The January 2024 cohort is the largest, indicating the highest number of new customer acquisitions at the beginning of the observed period.

Subsequent Decline: Following January, there is a consistent decline in the number of new customers acquired each month. The February 2024 cohort is significantly smaller than January, with 48 new customers.

Continued Reduction: This downward trend continues through the subsequent months. The March 2024 cohort size reduces further to 33, followed by April 2024 with 27 new customers.

Smallest Recent Cohorts: The most recent months in the dataset, May and June 2024, show the smallest cohort sizes, with 16 and 10 new customers respectively.

Conclusion: The analysis of cohort size by month reveals a distinct downward trend in new customer acquisition from January 2024 to June 2024. The initial cohort in January is the largest, and the size consistently diminishes in the following months, culminating in the smallest cohorts observed in May and June 2024. This trend suggests a decreasing rate of new customer acquisition over this six-month period.
